## Clone & Run locally

Notice: For running this app locally, you will need .env keys to connect to the APIs which only the dev team of this project has

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    - On the GitHub repo page, click the green "Code" button.

    - Copy the HTTPS URL.

2. **Open the Terminal:**

    - Open the terminal by typing "cmd" in your desktop's start menu, **OR**

    - Right-click on the desktop and select "Git Bash Here" (if you have Git Bash installed), **OR**

    - Open Visual Studio Code's terminal by clicking "Terminal" -> "New Terminal" inside the editor.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Location:**

    - In the terminal, navigate to your desired location (e.g., desktop) using the command: `cd desktop`. Adjust the path if your project is located elsewhere.

    - Ensure that your terminal's address is inside the project folder.

4. **Clone the Repository:**

    - Run the command: `git clone /link/`. Replace `/link/` with the HTTPS URL from step 1.

5. **Enter the Project Directory:**

    - Navigate into the cloned repository by typing: `cd /folder-name/`. Replace `/folder-name/` with the name of the cloned folder.

6. **Install Dependencies:**
